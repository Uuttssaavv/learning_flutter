## Basics of Navigation and Routing in Flutter
</br>

| **Concept**                 | **Description**                                                  | **Use Case** | **Example** |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Navigator**               | A widget that manages a stack of Route objects and provides methods for managing the stack. | Use to manage navigation stack for your app. | Navigate between different screens or pages. |
| **Route**                   | An abstract class representing a screen or page in the navigation stack. | Define new screens in the app. | Define a new screen for displaying user profile details. |
| **MaterialPageRoute**       | A modal route that replaces the entire screen with a platform-adaptive transition. | Standard way to create routes in Material Design apps. | Navigate to a new screen with a slide transition. |
| **Navigator.push**          | Method to add a route to the navigation stack.                   | Navigate to a new screen. | Open a detailed view of an item when tapped. |
| **Navigator.pop**           | Method to remove the current route from the navigation stack.    | Return to the previous screen. | Go back to the main screen from a detailed view. |
| **Navigator.pushReplacement** | Method to replace the current route with a new one.              | Replace the current screen without adding to the back stack. | Navigate to a login screen and prevent returning to the previous screen. |
| **Navigator.pushNamed**     | Method to navigate to a named route.                             | Navigate using route names for better management. | Navigate to a screen using a named route defined in the route table. |
| **Navigator.popUntil**      | Method to pop the navigation stack until a certain condition is met. | Return to a specific screen by popping multiple routes. | Return to the main screen from deep within the navigation stack. |
| **onGenerateRoute**         | A callback that is called when the app is asked to navigate to a named route. | Define custom navigation logic. | Handle dynamic routing based on the app state or URL parameters. |
| **onUnknownRoute**          | A callback that is called when the app is asked to navigate to an unknown route. | Handle unknown or undefined routes gracefully. | Show a 404 error screen when the user navigates to an unknown route. |
| **RouteObserver**           | A widget that subscribes to route change notifications.         | Track route changes and manage resources accordingly. | Pause a video when navigating away from the screen. |
